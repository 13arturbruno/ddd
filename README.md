# Sample Project - Tactical Modeling and DDD Patterns

This project is a practical example of applying tactical modeling and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) patterns in a specific context. The goal is to provide a solid foundation for software development, focusing on domain understanding and creating a robust design model.

## Overview

Domain-Driven Design is a software development approach that emphasizes collaboration between domain experts and developers to create a shared domain model. This project aims to demonstrate how to apply tactical modeling concepts such as aggregates, entities, value objects, and domain services, as well as the implementation of DDD patterns.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized according to DDD concepts. Here are the main components:

- **`src/`**: Contains the project source code.
  - **`domain/`**: Classes and logic related to the domain.
  - **`infrastructure/`**: Implementation details not belonging to the domain, such as persistence.

## Prerequisites

Make sure to have the following requirements installed before getting started:
